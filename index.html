                    <h2>Moving to Canada (2015)</h2>
                    <p>I was born and raised in the Philippines. I've always loved the tropical weather, food and culture. Moving to Canada was a big change as a 15 year old leaving behind life-long friends at family. As a kid that time, my priority was to adjust with the culture, school and many things.</p>

                    <h2>2018</h2>
                    <p> I finished High School in 2018 not really knowing what to pursue in college or even if I wanted to go. Confused, I decided attend university only to realize few years in that the program I was in was not really something I really liked. </p>

                    <h2>2019</h2>
                    <p> In 2019, i decided to quit school. I focused on earning and soon enough I  managed to open a small ecommerce clothing business. This is when I was introduced in designing, business, and website designing. Although making website through platforms like shopify and wix were fairly "easy" I realized that it costs a lot of money. I wanted to know how to develop my own website.</p>

                    <h2>2022</h2>
                    <p> I slowly lost motivation knowing that I never had an experience with programming. At this time, I knew I had to decide because it felt like I was doing a lot: working, doing business on the side, designing my logos, brainstorming... all of these and yet I'm not seeing the outcome I wanted to see. I decided to temporarily close my business. </p>

                    <h2>2023</h2>
                    <p> After taking my much needed rest I decided to enroll to CDI college to learn about web development. This again is my starting point. I will learn what I can in this program, apply this knowledge to my own website and work on my dream job. I realized that taking on too many things on early stages of my life had a huge effect on me. I learned to slow dowm. Take my time and do things at my own pace.</p>
